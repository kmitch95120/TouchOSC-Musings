# TouchOSC-Musings

This is a place for me to share some things I'm doing or have done with [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc). Everything I'm currently doing is with the TouchOSC version released in 2021 as TouchOSC mk2. While I might mention TouchOSC mk1 a few times, which was the original version I started using back in 2015, I'll only discuss that for historical reasons.

## Behringer X-Air Mixer

My first experience with using OSC ([Open Sound Control](https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/)) was with a Behringer X-Air Digital Audio Mixer.  At the time (2015) TouchOSC (now mk1) was a rather simple UI tool, which actually appealed to me since what I was trying to do was create a simple UI so a theatre tech director could load saved snapshots (i.e. mixer settings) during rehearsals without a FoH engineer being there.

## HomeSeer Control and Monitoring

I've been using a home automation software called [HomeSeer](https://www.homeseer.com/) for more than 20 years and I'm constantly looking for new UI tools to create touchscreen interfaces.  I have a couple of TouchOSC templates that use OSC to control lighting and other functions around the house.

## Reaper DAW Control

My DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) of choice is [Reaper](https://reaper.fm/).

## Node-RED

I regularly use a low-code development environment called [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/). The message-based, event-driven nature of Node-RED makes it a powerful tool in and of itself, but becomes even more useful when paired with TouchOSC.
