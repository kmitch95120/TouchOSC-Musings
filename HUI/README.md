# A Mackie® HUI® Control Surface Template (Work-In-Progress)

This template started with a request on Facebook for help with a HUI® fader. After searching for a while, I ran across a document, written by a very smart person many years ago, that documents their observations of the HUI® protocol.  [That document](HUI.pdf) as well as my own observations of the protocol using a [Behringer X-Touch](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0808-AAD) in HUI mode, was the basis for this template. After a request from [Tim Corpus](https://www.youtube.com/timcorpus) on the [TouchOSC Discord](https://discord.gg/TXz23QUeQC) server for a HUI® template for use with [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools), I developed it into what it is now.
